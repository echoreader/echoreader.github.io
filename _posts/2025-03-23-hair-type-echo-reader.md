# Understanding **Hair Type**

[**Hair Type**](https://pureglowhealth.blogspot.com/2025/02/understanding-your-hair-type.html)  refers to the texture and growth pattern of your hair, which is influenced by genetics, care routines, and environmental factors. Here's a guide to the most common hair types:

## **Hair Type** - Straight Hair
Straight hair is smooth in texture and tends to be oily since natural oils from the scalp distribute easily. It naturally shines and doesn’t tangle easily.

## **Hair Type** - Wavy Hair
Wavy hair has a light “S” shape pattern, making it a perfect middle ground between straight and curly. It has volume and is versatile for styling.

## **Hair Type** - Curly Hair
Curly hair showcases distinct curls and tends to be drier than straight hair. It requires specialized care to maintain moisture and definition.

## **Hair Type** - Coily Hair
Coily hair has tight, spring-like curls. This type is often fragile and demands extra hydration and special products for optimal health.
