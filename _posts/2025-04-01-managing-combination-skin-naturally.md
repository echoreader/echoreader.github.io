# How to Take Care of Combination Skin

[Combination skin](https://pureglowhealth.blogspot.com/2025/04/combination-skin-care-tips-balance.html) can be tricky to manage because it combines both oily and dry areas. The key to achieving healthy skin is understanding its unique needs and choosing the right Combination Skin products.

## Identifying Combination Skin

If your T-zone (forehead, nose, and chin) tends to be oily while your cheeks are dry or normal, you likely have combination skin. This skin type requires tailored care to balance its varying needs.

## Skincare Routine

- **Cleansing:** Use a gentle cleanser that removes excess oil without over-drying.
- **Moisturizing:** Apply lightweight moisturizer to oily areas and richer cream to dry areas.
- **Sun Protection:** Opt for an oil-free sunscreen to avoid clogging pores.

To learn more about caring for combination skin, consult dermatologists or skincare experts.
