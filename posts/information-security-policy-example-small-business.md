Hey, I run a small marketing agency with 12 people scattered across three states, and a few years ago I learned the hard way that *“we’re too small to be hacked”* is a myth. A single phishing email cost me $8,000 and two sleepless weeks. That’s when I built my first **information security policy** from scratch. In this guide, I’m handing you the exact **security policy example** I still use battle-tested, plain-English, and sized for a **small business** like yours. No 50-page corporate jargon. Just a practical **IT policy template** you can copy, tweak, and roll out before lunch.

We’ll cover **data protection**, **password policy**, **access control**, **employee training**, **incident response plan**, **network security**, **data backup**, **physical security**, **remote work policy**, and **BYOD policy** all tuned for U.S. **compliance** basics like CCPA and HIPAA if you touch personal data. By the end, you’ll have a plug-and-play **information security policy** that actually works.

*Current as of November 2025 always verify state laws, but this framework holds up nationwide.*

## Why Your Small Business Needs an Information Security Policy Now

I used to think policies were for banks. Then my bookkeeper clicked a fake PayPal link. **Data confidentiality** isn’t optional when you store client contracts, SSNs, or payment info. The average breach for businesses under 100 employees now runs $25,000, per IBM’s 2025 report. A clear **security policy example** does three things for you:

1. **Stops 80% of common attacks** (phishing, weak passwords, lost laptops).  
2. **Keeps you audit-ready** for insurance, clients, or regulations.  
3. **Builds trust** I close deals faster when I email prospects my one-page policy summary.

Think of it as a seatbelt: cheap, fast, and saves your butt when things go sideways.

## Step 1: Draft the Core Policy Statement

Start with a 100-word mission that everyone signs. Here’s mine:

> *“At [Your Company], we protect client and employee data with the same care we give our own. Every team member follows this **information security policy** to ensure **data confidentiality**, prevent unauthorized access, and respond fast to incidents. Violations may lead to discipline up to termination.”*

Post it on your intranet, Slack #policies, and the employee handbook. I make new hires initial it on day one.

## Key Sections to Include in Your Security Policy

I break my policy into eight bite-sized sections. Copy the headings, swap in your details, and you’re 90% done.

### 1. Acceptable Use Policy (AUP)
Spell out what’s allowed on company devices and accounts.

| Allowed | Prohibited |
|---------|------------|
| Work email, Slack, CRM | Torrent sites, personal crypto mining |
| Approved cloud apps (list them) | Installing unapproved software |
| Streaming during lunch on personal hotspot | Sharing work files via personal Gmail |

I caught an intern downloading pirated fonts once $200 fine avoided because the **acceptable use policy** was crystal clear.

### 2. Password Policy & Multi-Factor Authentication
Weak passwords are low-hanging fruit. My rule:

- **Minimum 12 characters**, one uppercase, one number, one symbol.  
- **No reuse** across sites use a password manager (I pay for 1Password for the team, $3/user/month).  
- **MFA everywhere**: email, cloud storage, bank logins.  

*“Password1!” is not a strategy,* I tell my team. Enforce it with Microsoft 365 or Google Workspace admin settings.

### 3. Access Control & Least Privilege
Only give access to what someone needs *today*. I use role-based folders in Google Drive:

- **Marketing**: Can edit campaign folders, read-only on finance.  
- **Finance**: Full access to QuickBooks, nothing else.  

Revoke access the day someone leaves I automate this with Zapier + HR spreadsheet.

### 4. Network Security & Remote Work Policy
With half my team remote, Wi-Fi rules matter.

- **Company VPN required** for any work on public Wi-Fi (I use NordLayer, $7/user/month).  
- **Home routers** must have WPA3 and unique passwords.  
- **No work on jailbroken/rooted devices**.

### 5. BYOD Policy (Bring Your Own Device)
Phones and laptops are breach vectors. My **BYOD policy** requires:

1. Up-to-date OS and antivirus (e.g., Malwarebytes).  
2. Company MDM profile (I use Mosyle for Macs, JumpCloud for mixed).  
3. Remote wipe capability if lost.

I reimburse $30/month for compliant personal phones cheaper than buying hardware.

### 6. Physical Security
Don’t forget the real world.

- **Office**: Keycard entry, visitor log, screens auto-lock after 5 minutes.  
- **Home offices**: Lock laptops when stepping away; no leaving devices in cars overnight.

I once found a contractor’s laptop in a coffee shop bathroom **physical security** training saved us.

### 7. Data Backup & Recovery
**Data backup** is non-negotiable. My 3-2-1 rule:

- **3 copies**: Local SSD, cloud, off-site.  
- **2 media types**: HDD + Google Drive.  
- **1 off-site**: Encrypted Backblaze bucket ($7/TB/month).

Test restores quarterly I schedule them like dentist appointments.

### 8. Incident Response Plan
When (not if) something happens, speed wins. My one-page **incident response plan**:

| Step | Who | Action | Timeframe |
|------|-----|--------|-----------|
| 1. Detect | All | Report to security@ via Slack or phone | <15 min |
| 2. Contain | IT Lead (me) | Disconnect device, change passwords | <1 hour |
| 3. Assess | Owner + IT | Log impact, check backups | <4 hours |
| 4. Recover | IT | Restore from backup, monitor | <24 hours |
| 5. Report | Owner | Notify clients/insurers if PII breached | Per law (e.g., 72 hrs for CCPA) |

I run a tabletop drill every six months 30 minutes, pizza provided.

## Employee Training: Make It Stick

Policies gather dust without training. I do:

- **Onboarding**: 20-minute video + quiz (Google Forms).  
- **Monthly micro-lessons**: 5-minute Slack threads (“Spot the phishing link”).  
- **Annual refresh**: Live Zoom with fake breach scenario.

*“People are the weakest link and the first line of defense,”* says Kevin Mitnick, and I quote him in every session.

## Compliance Cheat Sheet for U.S. Small Businesses

| Regulation | Triggers | Your Must-Do |
|------------|----------|--------------|
| **CCPA/CPRA** | CA customers, >$25M revenue or 50k records | Privacy notice, deletion requests |
| **HIPAA** | Health data | BAA with cloud vendors, risk analysis |
| **NY SHIELD Act** | NY residents’ private data | Reasonable safeguards (this policy qualifies) |
| **Insurance** | Cyber policy | Annual training + written policy |

I keep a one-pager in my Google Drive auditors love it.

## Tools I Use to Enforce the Policy (All Under $15/user/month)

| Need | Tool | Cost | Why I Chose It |
|------|------|------|----------------|
| Passwords | 1Password Teams | $3.99 | Business vault + SSO |
| MDM/BYOD | Mosyle (Mac) or JumpCloud | $2–$6 | Wipe lost devices |
| VPN | NordLayer | $7 | Per-user billing |
| Backup | Backblaze | $7/TB | Unlimited versions |
| Training | KnowBe4 Go | $3 | 5-min monthly videos |

Total for 12 users: ~$180/month. Less than one lost laptop.

## Key Takeaways

- **Start with the template** customize in under an hour.  
- **Train monthly**; one good habit beats 10 rules.  
- **Automate access** offboard in 5 minutes, not 5 days.  
- **Backup everything** test restores like you test smoke alarms.  
- **Document incidents** turns mistakes into insurance discounts.

## FAQ

**Do I really need a written policy if we’re only 5 people?**  
Yes. Courts, insurers, and clients ask for it. My one-pager closed a $50k deal last year.

**What if an employee ignores the BYOD policy?**  
First offense: warning + training. Second: lose reimbursement, use company device. I’ve enforced it twice no hard feelings.

**How often should I update the policy?**  
Annually or after any breach/tool change. I version it in Google Docs (v1.0, v1.1…).

**Can I use free tools instead of paid?**  
For passwords (Bitwarden) and backup (Google Drive), yes but accept the limits. I pay for peace of mind.

**Where do I store the policy so everyone sees it?**  
Notion page + signed PDF in HR folder. Link it in Slack #announcements.

## Conclusion: Your 30-Day Action Plan

Day 1: Copy the **security policy example** above into a doc.  
Day 2–3: Swap in your company name, tools, and roles.  
Day 4: Email it to the team with a 5-question Google Form quiz.  
Day 7: Schedule first monthly training (phishing demo).  
Day 30: Run a fake incident drill timer starts when Slack pings.

I did this exact plan in 2022. Zero breaches since. Your clients sleep better, your insurance rep stops nagging, and you stop waking up at 3 a.m. wondering if that laptop in the Uber had unencrypted files. Grab the template, sign it, and get back to growing your business.
